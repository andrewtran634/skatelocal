#How to download and use...because it's not deployed...yet!
	1.	Clone, or download zip file to a directory
	2.	In the directory, if you don't have django, download it! 
		-Make sure your path has python (if you are a windows user), and you have pip installed 
		--if not, install pip, it's the bomb! 
			-install django to the directory you have the project in --> python -m pip install django
	3.	Install all the other dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
	4.	run this command --> python manage.py runserver
	5.	open a browser, preferably firefox or chrome, and go to 127.0.0.1:8000/ (unless otherwise specified when running the server)
		You're done!
